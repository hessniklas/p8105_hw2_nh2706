# Problem 2

# Problem 3

## 3.1) pols-month.csv related tasks

``` r
# Loading the data and cleaning the variables
polsm_df = read_csv("./Data/pols-month.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

# Separating variable MON into individual pieces
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%

# Arranging entire dataset based on the year and month
  arrange(year, as.integer(month)) %>%
  
# Replacing month number with month name and creating a president variable taking values gop and dem
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         month = month.name[as.integer(month)],
         president = if_else(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop")
         ) %>%

# Removing prez_dem, prez_gop, and day variables
  select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop)
```

## 3.2) snp.csv related tasks

``` r
# Loading the data and cleaning the variables
snp_df = read_csv("./Data/snp.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

# Separating variable DATE into individual pieces, and modifying years to show long version
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         month = as.integer(month),
         year = ifelse(year >= 23, year + 1900, year + 2000)
         ) %>%

# Arranging according to year and month, organizing so that year and month are the leading columns, and converting month to long-format
  relocate(year) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>%

# Removing day variables
  select(-day)
```

## 3.3) unemployment.csv related tasks

``` r
# Loading the data
unemployment_df = read_csv("./Data/unemployment.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%

# Switching from “wide” to “long” format
  pivot_longer("Jan":"Dec",
        names_to = "month",
        values_to = "unemployment"
        ) %>%

# Ensuring that key variables have the same name, and take the same values
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate( month = month.name[match(month, month.abb)],
          year = as.integer(year)
         )
```

## 3.4) Merging Datasets

``` r
# Merging snp into pols
alldata_df = full_join(polsm_df, snp_df)

# Merging unemployment into the result
alldata_df = full_join(alldata_df, unemployment_df)
```
